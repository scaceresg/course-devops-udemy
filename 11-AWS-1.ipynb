    "### What is Cloud Computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Computing consists of accessing virtualised resources over the network (e.g. a website online). \n",
    "\n",
    "AWS, Azure, Google Cloud are some of the big names in the Public Cloud Computing environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Computing for AWS**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*Benefits:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Agility: You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Elasticity: You provision the amount of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cost savings: The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deploy globally in minutes: You can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Types of cloud computing:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Similar to existing IT services. EC2 services of AWS are an example of IaaS.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Removes the need for managing underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows to focus on the deployment and management of applications. AWS RDS services for Oracle Data Bases, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Provides a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. You don't have to think about maintaining the service or the underlying infrastructure but about how to use that particular service."

    "When building a cluster of services (multiple servers), you need a single endpoint to access them and that's mostly provided through a **Load Balancer**.\n",

    "**Ports**:\n",

    "* **Frontend Port**: Listens from the User Requests on this port aka \"Listeners\" (generally on port $443$ for https)\n",

    "\n",
    "ELB supports three types of load balancers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Application Load Balancer: Popular for web traffic (websites, apps, http & https). It routes traffic based on advanced application level information that includes the content of the request. (Level 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Network Load Balancer: Functions at the 4th layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can handle millions of requests per second. It gets a static IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Classic Load Balancer: Simplest one. It routes traffic based on either application or network level information.\n",
