    "\n",
    "* This is where **Containers** come in: a container is just a directory which contains its own file system, similar to the OS file system (like a mini OS), and can be all connected together through a virtualised network.\n",

    "    - Each container is connected through an assigned IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Each container is then of very light weight -> Can be archived as an image/container image.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The purpose of archiving in container images is to ship these anywhere you want.\n",
