    "**Open Source**: Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. A common misconception is thinking that open source software is \"free of charge\". But, the real difference is the access that many people (developers) have to the software code and thus, the capacity of improving it, compared to a private source software.\n",
