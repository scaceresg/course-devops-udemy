    "\n",
    "* When developers are pushing code to the repository, every commit *is built and tested immediately*, so no waiting and collecting all these codes with bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The process should be automated: When developers commit any changes to the code, the automated process should fetch the code, build it, test it and send a failure notification so the developers fix the code and commit it again.\n",
